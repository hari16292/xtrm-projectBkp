In the words of \"Cousin Eddy\" from \"National Lampoons Christmas Vacation:\" \"Thats the gift that keeps on giving the whole year.\" AMC, the first in the exhibition industry to offer personalized gift cards, was also the first in the industry to launch circuit-wide gift cards in 2002. We think thats pretty cool, too. Headquartered in Leawood, KS, AMC Entertainment Inc. is a leading theatrical exhibition and entertainment company. With a history of industry leadership and innovation dating back to 1920, the company today serves hundreds of millions of guests annually at 1,000 theatres with over 11,000 screens worldwide.</p>\n<p>AMC Gift Cards are also now redeemable for Private Theatre Rentals. Use your gift card on a Private Theatre Rental and watch a movie with 1-20 total guests in your own AMC Safe & Clean™ theatre, starting at just $99+tax.
